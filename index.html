Well you can hire a hacker and if the hacker is able to get your details, the entire hacker's fee and penalty for your data breach is on us! We assure this won't happen &#128522;

                    At AntRuhi, we believe that if you marry for love and your betterhalf is compatible, life is happy for you. Now think of it on a larger social scale.

So we intend to keep every segment of society empowered to use this service without thinking of payment.

                    Well, AntRuhi gives you superpowers, and you are expected to use the superpowers to find your better-half to settle with. Don't use it as a dating-only platform, go beyond that. You have lot of dating apps like Tinder, Bumble, Truly-Madly, OkCupid, Happn etc. Use those apps if you want just a date. Use AntRuhi for good things beyond dating: connect > date > commit > marry.

                    No. AntRuhi does not entertain any such requests. AntRuhi does not work like a marriage bureau or marriage society. AntRuhi is an new-age automated service that finds prospects compatible for you as your better-half and works in a systematic way. Know more about its working <a href="#howitworks">here</a>. Please note that requests to share contact details of wedding prospects will be ignored and you will receive no response to such requests.

                    Very simple. You start with Shortcake Listener. You build your compatibility profile using it. Go through <a href="#howitworks">how it works section</a> to understand what happens step by step.

  <a id="blog - Need of compatible marriages in India" hidden>marriage blog marriage article Need of compatible marriages in India
    Arrange marriages, where parents make their kids to marry with strangers in the same community is very common in India. It’s not that bad at all because
    1.It give parents a pride in getting their kids availed their life partners in situations where kids are not able to find one themselves or when the belief of “kids should not get into love affairs” is strong.
    2.It give parents a pride in society where they can say their kids are married so that no one can ask when are their kids getting married.
    3.It give parents a satisfaction that they got into matrimonial tie with another family from the same sect or community in order to preserve the culture.
    4.It give parents happy hopes that soon they will become grandparents, probably in maximum of two years.
    5.It give parents a sense of accomplishment about their age-long financial planning for getting their kids married has been successful.
    6.It give parents a mega socialization day where they get to meet all the distant relatives of their distant relatives of their distant relatives who contribute in a thick wedding album.
    But what’s in there for the couple who actually got married?
    Probably a sense of losing out beautiful experience of having a girlfriend or boyfriend and marring to that person?
    Probably a nervousness of getting physical with a person who met barely and that too on the first intimacy night “suhagrat” organized by parents themselves, and even worse when physical compatibility and intimacy levels are unknown?
    Probably missing out a super awesome girl or boy from other community, other state and speaking other mother-tongue?
    Probably discomfort of not having privacy in planning their babies?
    Probably not mixing up with food / drinking / smoking habits of arrange marriage spouse? Probably not mixing up with their family culture and new home after wedding? Probably not finding cleanliness habits great?
    Probably not finding the spouse to be intellectually matching?
    Probably a realization that budget planning could have been efficient if parents were not adamant on pleasing relatives and all degree of distant relatives?
    Probably a boring life as a sequel of keeping community norms intact as a part of alliance between two families?
    Probably a fear of know having known the life-background of the spouse properly?
    People in India are evolving faster than ever and faster than elsewhere in terms of lifestyle and therefore need to evolve their life partner search as well.
    What is compatible marriage?
    A life event where you decide to live with someone whom you love and comfortable with that person’s personality and intellect level, from a point where you can’t imagine living without that person henceforth.
    And why is it needed anyways?
    Marriages that happen due to
    1.Push of family
    2.Push of society
    3.Push of community customs
    4.Push of a post-education psychology
    often ends up in situations where either of the two partners are not compatible with each other. In such situation, one partner forces themselves to adjust. If the adjustment happens, some level of happiness is achieved. If adjustment does not happen, then things often end up in divorce, depression, bad health, extramarital affairs and kids getting less parental attention or seeing family stress at home.
    Significantly high number of marriages happen in India because of one of these four pushes.
    How to take efforts for a compatible marriage?
    Once you have made your mind to break the archaic realms and only settle down for a compatible life partner, you need to
    1.Give it some time: There can be many compatible ones for you but you need to wait till you find that compatible one with whom you can connect with hearts.
    2.Keep your personality strong: Have a faith in your personality and keep it the biggest criteria. Know what you don’t want. Settle down with someone who accepts you in your personality and you accepts them in their personality and yet live in complete harmony.
    3.Let go of orthodox concepts: Slowly start drifting yourself away from chains of community norms. This can be for example, finding a partner who shares your cast, your sect, your mother-tongue. Keep yourself open to people. Compatible, intellect, heart bonding person who can love you unconditionally can be anywhere. They can be speaking any other language. They can belong to any sect and that might be largely immaterial to them. Raise your voice for yourself when needed.
    4.Know everything: Identify your lifestyle, your likes and dislikes, your habits, the kind of habits you want in your partner, the kind of lifestyle you need in your partner and ask these things early.
    Why do people go for marriage afterall? Why is it difficult to think of a life without partner?
    Usually in childhood or in 20s, naturally and unknowingly, people build soft corner for someone they know in-person whom they just know about. This process is called first or early infatuation. This is natural, biological and happens to almost everyone in early ages, and goes unrealized. Later on people move ahead in life but the soft corner remains at its place as a void. Once people establish themselves in education and financially, they realize this void and therefore look for someone to settle down with.

  <a id="blog - The Thrill of the Chase: Finding a Compatible Relationship" hidden>marriage blog marriage article The Thrill of the Chase: Finding a Compatible Relationship
    You know what’s hard to find? A compatible relationship. It’s like trying to find a needle in a haystack, except the haystack is full of other needles that are just not quite the right size. But seriously, it’s tough out there. It’s like we’re all walking around with little puzzle pieces, hoping that we’ll find someone whose pieces fit perfectly with ours. And let’s be honest, sometimes it feels like we’re trying to put together a puzzle with pieces from three different sets. It’s like, you want someone who shares your interests, but not so much that you end up fighting over who gets to control the remote. You want someone who has the same sense of humor as you, but not so much that you both end up telling the same jokes all the time.
    And let’s not even get started on the whole “opposites attract” thing. Because sure, it’s nice to have someone who balances you out, but it’s also nice to have someone who doesn’t leave the toilet seat up all the time. And then there’s the whole communication thing. You want someone who can communicate effectively, but not so much that they’re constantly bombarding you with text messages and phone calls. You want someone who can read your mind, but not so much that you feel like they’re invading your privacy.
    And don’t even get me started on the whole “love languages” thing. Because apparently, we all have different ways of showing and receiving love. Like, some people want gifts, some people want quality time, some people want physical touch. It’s like we’re all speaking different languages, and we’re all trying to learn each other’s without a translator.
    But you know what? Despite all the challenges, there are still compatible relationships out there. And when you find one, it’s like a breath of fresh air. It’s like finally finding the missing puzzle piece that completes the picture. So, here’s to all the compatible relationships out there. May you continue to thrive and grow together, and may you never accidentally try to put a square peg in a round hole.
    You know, sometimes it can feel like we’re playing a game of cat and mouse when it comes to finding a compatible relationship. It’s like we’re chasing after something we can’t quite catch, and it’s just out of reach.
    But what if I told you that sometimes, the most compatible relationships are the ones that surprise us the most? What if I told you that sometimes, the person you think is completely wrong for you is actually the one you’re meant to be with? It sounds crazy, right? But it happens more often than you might think. Sometimes, the sparks fly when we least expect it, and we find ourselves falling head over heels for someone we never thought we would. It’s like a rollercoaster ride, full of ups and downs and unexpected twists and turns. You never know what’s going to happen next, but that’s what makes it so exciting. And sometimes, the journey to finding a compatible relationship can be a bit scary. It’s like walking through a dark forest, not knowing what’s lurking around the next corner. But when you finally emerge from the shadows and find that special someone, it’s like the sun coming out after a storm.
    So, if you’re feeling a bit scared or uncertain about finding a compatible relationship, don’t worry. Sometimes, the best things in life come when we least expect them. So, keep an open mind, be willing to take risks, and trust that the universe has a plan for you. Who knows? The love of your life might be just around the corner, waiting for you to take that next step. So, embrace the thrill of the chase, and get ready for the adventure of a lifetime.

  <a id="blog - Breaking Boundaries: A Love Story Beyond Culture and Tradition" hidden>
    marriage blog marriage article Breaking Boundaries: A Love Story Beyond Culture and Tradition Once upon a time, in a bustling city in India, there lived a young couple named Aman and Nisha. Aman was a Punjabi boy who worked in a bank, while Nisha was a South Indian girl who was an aspiring actress. They were deeply in love and wanted to get married. However, their families were against their relationship because of their different backgrounds and cultures. Aman’s family was staunchly traditional and believed in the Sikh religion, while Nisha’s family was more liberal and followed Hinduism. Despite their families’ objections, Aman and Nisha were determined to be together.
    One day, they decided to move in together in a small apartment in the city. They knew that living together before marriage was frowned upon by their families, but they didn’t care. They were in love and wanted to spend every moment together. At first, things were great. They cooked meals together, watched movies, and talked for hours. However, as time went on, they started to notice their differences. Aman loved to listen to Punjabi music, while Nisha preferred South Indian classical music. Aman loved spicy food, while Nisha couldn’t handle it. But the biggest difference between them was their approach to physical intimacy. Aman had grown up in a conservative household where physical intimacy was never discussed, while Nisha had a more liberal upbringing where it was seen as a natural part of life.
    One night, as they lay in bed, Aman tentatively broached the subject. “Nisha, I love you so much and I want to spend my life with you, but I feel like there’s something missing between us.”
    Nisha looked at him quizzically. “What do you mean?”
    Aman hesitated for a moment before continuing. “I mean… I feel like we haven’t fully explored our physical connection.” Nisha’s eyes widened in surprise, but then she smiled. “I understand what you’re saying. Physical intimacy is an important part of a relationship, and I’m willing to explore that with you.”
    And so they did. They started exploring each other’s bodies, learning what each other liked and didn’t like. They communicated openly and honestly about their desires and fantasies, and slowly but surely, they became more comfortable with each other.
    However, their families still didn’t approve of their relationship. Aman’s family thought Nisha was too modern and liberal, while Nisha’s family thought Aman was too conservative and traditional. They tried to convince Aman and Nisha to break up and find partners from their own communities. But Aman and Nisha were determined to make their relationship work. They knew that their love and their physical compatibility were more important than their cultural differences.
    One day, they decided to take their families out to dinner at a fancy restaurant in the city. They dressed up in their finest clothes and nervously waited for their families to arrive. As they sat down to dinner, the conversation was strained and awkward. Aman’s family kept insisting that he should marry a Punjabi girl, while Nisha’s family kept talking about the importance of finding a partner who shared their values and traditions.
    But then, something unexpected happened. Aman’s father started coughing and choking on his food. Nisha immediately sprang into action, performing the Heimlich maneuver on him and saving his life. Everyone at the table was shocked and grateful. Aman’s family thanked Nisha profusely, and Nisha’s family realized that she was more than just a modern, liberal girl — she was a caring and compassionate person who had saved their son’s father’s life.
    After that night, Aman and Nisha’s families slowly started to come around. They saw that their love was genuine and that they were truly happy. As Aman and Nisha’s families started to come around, there was still one obstacle in their path. Nisha’s ex-boyfriend, who had always been jealous of Aman, was determined to ruin their relationship.
    One day, when Aman was at work, Nisha received a message from her ex-boyfriend. He threatened to reveal intimate photos of her that they had taken together, which could potentially destroy her career as an actress. Nisha was terrified and didn’t know what to do. She didn’t want to lose Aman or her career, but she also didn’t want to let her ex-boyfriend control her life. She decided to confide in Aman and tell him everything. Aman was shocked and angry, but he also knew that he loved Nisha and would do anything to protect her.
    Together, they came up with a plan. They would confront Nisha’s ex-boyfriend and try to convince him to delete the photos. They knew it was a risky move, but they were determined to take action. They arranged to meet her ex-boyfriend at a café, but things quickly turned ugly. He refused to delete the photos and started threatening them. Suddenly, he lunged at Nisha, trying to grab her phone. Aman quickly stepped in and tackled him to the ground. They wrestled for a few moments before Aman emerged victorious, holding her ex-boyfriend in a headlock. As they struggled on the ground, Nisha realized that Aman was the one she truly loved. She ran over to him and hugged him tightly, grateful for his bravery and his love. Her ex-boyfriend eventually calmed down and deleted the photos. Aman and Nisha went home, relieved that they could finally put the incident behind them.
    From that day on, Aman and Nisha’s love grew stronger. They knew that they had overcome a major obstacle, and that they could face anything as long as they were together. Their families finally came to accept their relationship, and they lived happily ever after.

  <a id="blog - Falling for a Fantasy: How to Move On from Someone You’ve Never Met" hidden>marriage blog marriage article Falling for a Fantasy: How to Move On from Someone You’ve Never Met
    Aakriti had been swiping on a dating app for a few weeks when she came across a profile that caught her eye. It was a picture of a handsome man with a great smile, and his profile said that he loved hiking and trying new restaurants — just like Aakriti did. She swiped right, and to her surprise, they matched. Aakriti was thrilled, and she couldn’t wait to start chatting with this guy. She imagined all the things they could do together — hiking in the mountains, trying new foods, and exploring the city. But as she started typing out a message, she hesitated. What should she say? How could she make a good impression? Aakriti felt nervous, and she wasn’t sure how to start a conversation with someone she had never met.
    Days turned into weeks, and Aakriti found herself checking the app every day, hoping to see a new message from the man. She thought about him constantly, wondering what he was doing and if he was thinking about her too. But as time went on, Aakriti started to realize that she was getting too caught up in this fantasy. She had never actually talked to this man, and she had no idea if they would even get along in person. She was wasting her time pining after someone who might not even exist outside of a dating app. So, Aakriti made the tough decision to delete the app from her phone. It was a small step, but it felt like a weight had been lifted off her shoulders. She knew that she had to move on from this fantasy, and focus on building real connections with people in her life.
    Months went by, and Aakriti went on dates, met new friends, and explored new hobbies. She had almost forgotten about the man on the dating app, until one day, she received a message from him.
    It was a short message, asking her how she was doing. Aakriti was surprised — she had never thought she would hear from this man again. But as she read the message, she realized that she didn’t feel the same way about him as she used to. She had moved on, and she was happy with her life the way it was. Aakriti replied to the message, but she kept her response short and polite. She didn’t want to give this man false hope or lead him on. She knew that it was time for her to truly move on, and focus on building connections with the people who were already in her life.
    In the end, Aakriti learned that sometimes, the best way to move on from someone is to never actually meet them at all. By deleting the dating app and focusing on the present, she was able to build a fulfilling life for herself, without getting caught up in the fantasy of online dating.
    It all started with a simple swipe. She was confidently swiping through dating app, when she stumbled upon a profile that caught her eyes. She was hopelessly infatuated with a man whom I had only seen a photo of. All she knew was that he was gorgeous and she wanted to know him. But how are you supposed to get over someone whom you had never even interacted, let alone met in person?
    Step 1: Accept reality
    The first step in getting over someone whom you have only seen a photo of is to accept reality. Yes, this person may be incredibly attractive, but they are still a stranger. You don’t know anything about their personality, their interests, or even if they’re single. Don’t get caught up in the fantasy of what could be — focus on the reality of what is.
    Step 2: Get some perspective
    With reality accepted, it’s time to get some perspective. Ask yourself, is this person really worth all this mental energy? Is there something deeper driving your infatuation? Maybe you’re feeling lonely or unfulfilled in other areas of your life. Understanding why you’re so fixated on this person can help you move on.
    Step 3: Take action
    Once you’ve gained some perspective, it’s time to take action. If you’re constantly checking their profile or daydreaming about them, it’s time to take a break from the dating app. Delete the app or take a hiatus — whatever you need to do to distance yourself from the object of your affection.
    Step 4: Find a distraction
    With the dating app deleted, it’s time to find a distraction. Pursue a new hobby or passion, hang out with friends, or binge-watch your favorite TV show. By filling your time with other activities, you’ll be less likely to dwell on the person you’ve never actually met.
    Step 5: Laugh about it
    As you move forward, it’s important to find the humor in the situation. After all, it’s not every day that you become infatuated with someone whom you’ve never met. Share your story with friends and find the humor in the absurdity of it all. Laughter truly is the best medicine.
    Step 6: Keep an open mind
    Finally, it’s important to keep an open mind. Just because things didn’t work out with this mystery person doesn’t mean that there aren’t other amazing people out there. Keep an open heart and an open mind, and you’ll be surprised at the incredible connections you’ll make.
    In conclusion, getting over someone whom you have only seen a photo of can be challenging, but it’s not impossible. By accepting reality, gaining perspective, taking action, finding distractions, laughing about the situation, and keeping an open mind, you’ll be able to move on and find happiness with someone who’s real and right for you. So, delete that dating app, find a new hobby, and remember — there’s more to life than a single photo.
    — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —
    At Ant’Ruhi, we are building a platform where forward thinking Indian singles can find their compatible life partner with whom they can live their life most happily.

    <a id="blog - Falling for a Fantasy: How to Move On from Someone You’ve Never Met" hidden>marriage blog marriage article How to Navigate Online Matrimony When Your Prospect Doesn’t Meet Expectations
      Are you feeling disillusioned after meeting an online prospect who didn’t quite meet your expectations in person? Maybe they didn’t look like their pictures, or maybe you just didn’t feel the chemistry you thought you would. Whatever the reason, it can be disheartening to invest time and energy into getting to know someone online, only to find that they’re not the right fit for you. But don’t despair — there are ways to navigate this situation and come out on top.
      1. Take some time to reflect.
      Before you jump to conclusions about your online prospect, take some time to reflect on what it is that you’re looking for in a partner. What are your deal breakers, and what qualities are non-negotiable for you? Make a list of the things that matter most to you, and use it as a guide when evaluating potential matches.
      2. Give them a chance.
      It’s easy to dismiss someone after one interaction if there’s no immediate chemistry or spark. However, it’s important to remember that first impressions can be deceiving. Sometimes people are nervous or guarded on a first interaction, and it takes a bit of time for their true personality to shine through. So give your online prospect a chance — go on a few meetings or phone converastions and see if there’s potential for a deeper connection.
      3. Communicate openly.
      If you’re feeling unsure about your online prospect, it’s important to communicate openly and honestly with them. Let them know how you’re feeling, and give them the opportunity to share their thoughts as well. If you’re not feeling the chemistry, it’s better to be upfront and honest about it rather than stringing them along. They may appreciate your candor and respect you for it.
      4. Don’t settle.
      It’s easy to settle for someone who doesn’t quite meet all of your expectations, especially if you’ve been single for a while. But settling for someone who isn’t right for you can lead to unhappiness in the long run. Don’t be afraid to keep searching for someone who truly makes you happy.
      5. Learn from the experience.
      If your online prospect doesn’t turn out as expected, use the experience as an opportunity to learn and grow. Think about what you liked and didn’t like about the person, and use that information to refine your search for a partner. Maybe you need to adjust your expectations, or maybe you need to be more specific in what you’re looking for. Whatever the case may be, use this experience to make yourself a better and more discerning online matrimony user.
      6. Take a break.
      If you’re feeling discouraged after a string of bad online prospects, it may be time to take a break and focus on other areas of your life. Spend time with friends and family, pursue your hobbies and interests, and take some time to focus on self-care. When you’re feeling refreshed and rejuvenated, you’ll be better equipped to approach the online dating scene with renewed energy and optimism.
      In conclusion, online dating can be a rollercoaster ride of emotions and experiences. But by being honest with yourself, giving people a chance, communicating openly, not settling, learning from your experiences, and taking a break when necessary, you can increase your chances of finding a great match online. So don’t give up hope — there’s someone out there for everyone, and with a little patience and perseverance, you’ll find your perfect match.
